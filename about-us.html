          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p class="subtitle">
            <i>A Typical Journey to D2</i> is a short, comedic film that pokes
            fun at the everyday drama of dining at NYUAD's famous D2 hall. What
            began as a casual idea quickly grew into a playful story that every
            student here can relate to.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle">
            As students ourselves, we wanted to capture the shared humor and
            frustrations of campus life. From the scorching walk over to the
            stubborn doors, we've lived these moments just like everyone else,
            and turning them into comedy felt like the perfect way to bring that
            shared experience to life.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle">
            The film takes viewers through the highs and (mostly) lows of the D2
            experience: battling with doors that never seem to work, waiting in
            lines that test the limits of human patience, and realizing too late
            that your meal swipes have run out. It's an exaggerated, funny
            reflection of a reality all NYUAD students know too well.

          Since our film unfolds almost entirely within D2, it only makes sense
          to shine a spotlight on the setting itself. Officially known as the
          West Dining Hall, D2 houses a mix of restaurants and food counters
          that try to satisfy the endless cravings of a very hungry campus.
          Inside, you'll find a variety of counters serving everything from
          quick bites to full meals, each with its own quirks and fan favorites.
          To get a closer look at the places that inspired our story, check out
          some of D2's dining spots below. You can also find their menus <a href="https://www.nutritics.com/menu/RoyalCatering" target="_blank">here</a>.
